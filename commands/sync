# - if this is a MS Office or LibreOffice document, do nothing -- there are plugins for these products, at least for MS
# - we only care about attachements, mainly PDF
# - or HTML documents; generate the HTML of the document first, compare with remote stored version, mark changes, merge, commit, push, publish
# - get local current version, compare with remote
# - merge remote changes with local version
# - push changes, with attachments, to remote repository
